The frontend for this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is a toy app for scraping and displaying some data from amazon product listings

## To run this app locally

- npm install (this app was tested and developed on node 10.6.0, npm 6.1.0)
- Follow the instructions in example.env to add your mysql credentials
- Once connected to mysql, run `node node_modules/db-migrate/bin/db-migrate up` to create the required table
- npm start to boot up the front end on localhost:3000 (webpack -dev server)
- npm run start-api to boot up the api server on localhost:3030
- npm run test-api to run integration tests
- npm run build will give you a production build artifact on the front end in the folder /build (thanks create react app!)

## Some Technologies used
